            Invented in the 1950s, VR's development has experienced peaks and troughs. 
            The first VR head-mounted display (HMD) system, The Sword of Damocles, was invented in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland and his student Bob Sproull.
            Meanwhile, the term “virtual reality” was popularised by Jaron Lanier in the 1980s
